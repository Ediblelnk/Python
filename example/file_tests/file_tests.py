    "It can be understood as either a sequence of characters or "
    "a sequence of words, but itâ€™s most common to work at the "
    "level of words. The deep-learning sequence-processing models "
    "introduced in the following sections can use text to produce "
    "a basic form of natural-l-anguage understanding, sufficient "
    "for applications including document classification, sentiment "
    "analysis, author identification, and even question-answering "
    "(QA) (in a constrained context). Of course, keep in mind "
    "throughout this chapter that none of these deep-learning models "
    "truly understand text in a human sense; rather, these models "
    "can map the statistical structure of written language, which "
    "is sufficient to solve many simple textual tasks. Deep learning "
    "for natural-language processing is pattern recognition applied "
    "to words, sentences, and paragraphs, in much the same way that "
    "computer vision is pattern recognition applied to pixels.")
