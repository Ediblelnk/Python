Text is one of the most widespread forms of sequence data. 
It can be understood as either a sequence of characters or 
a sequence of words, but itâ€™s most common to work at the 
level of words. The deep-learning sequence-processing models 
introduced in the following sections can use text to produce 
a basic form of natural-l-anguage understanding, sufficient 
for applications including document classification, sentiment 
analysis, author identification, and even question-answering 
(QA) (in a constrained context). Of course, keep in mind 
throughout this chapter that none of these deep-learning models 
truly understand text in a human sense; rather, these models 
can map the statistical structure of written language, which 
is sufficient to solve many simple textual tasks. Deep learning 
for natural-language processing is pattern recognition applied 
to words, sentences, and paragraphs, in much the same way that 
computer vision is pattern recognition applied to pixels.
